# Project WebCraft: Drag-and-Drop Website Builder and Hosting Platform

This project aims to develop an intuitive, user-friendly drag-and-drop website builder, enabling users to effortlessly create and customize their own websites without any coding knowledge. The core of this platform is the concept of Spaces – personalized areas where users can host their built websites.

## Features

1. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: A simple, yet powerful interface that allows users to select, customize, and arrange various website components such as text boxes, images, videos, and interactive elements. The goal is to make website creation as easy as dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas.
2. **Customizable Templates**: A variety of professionally designed templates that cater to different styles and industries. These templates provide a starting point for users to create their unique websites.
3. **Spaces Hosting**: Each user will have their own Space – a dedicated area for hosting their created website. This Space acts as a digital plot, providing the infrastructure and tools needed to maintain and update their website.
4. **Domain Registration and Integration**: Users will have the option to register a new domain through the platform or integrate their existing domain. This feature ensures that users can personalize their web presence fully and make their Spaces easily accessible on the web.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that all websites created are mobile-friendly and responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
6. **SEO and Analytics Tools**: Built-in tools to help users optimize their websites for search engines and track visitor statistics, enabling them to make informed decisions to grow their online presence.
7. **User Account Management**: A secure system for users to create accounts, manage their subscriptions, and maintain their Spaces. This includes options for password recovery, profile customization, and support features.
